    excerpt: "Buying a home is confusing and scary. Here's what actually helped me get through it.",
    content: `
      <h2>My first time buying a home</h2>
      <p>I spent so many nights looking at home loan calculators, wondering if I'd ever figure this out. Buying your first home feels like everyone expects you to know stuff nobody ever taught you. Here's what I wish someone had told me.</p>
      
      <h3>Check your money situation first</h3>
      <p>Before you start looking at houses, make sure your finances are ready:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> You want 620 or higher for better rates</li>
        <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> You don't need 20%. Lots of people put down 3-5%</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency money:</strong> Keep this separate from your down payment</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly bills:</strong> Keep all your payments under 43% of what you make</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Get approved for a home loan first</h3>
      <p>There's a difference between getting pre-qualified and pre-approved. Pre-qualified is just a guess. Pre-approved means a lender actually looked at your paperwork and said yes. Get pre-approved. It shows sellers you're serious about buying.</p>
      
      <h3>The extra costs nobody tells you about</h3>
      <p>Your down payment is just the beginning. You also need money for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extra costs when buying (2-5% of home price)</li>
        <li>Home inspection ($300-500)</li>
        <li>Moving costs</li>
        <li>Things that break right after you move in</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Looking for houses</h3>
      <p>Make a list of what you really need versus what would be nice to have. You won't find everything on your list. Focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location and how long it takes to get to work</li>
        <li>The neighborhood</li>
        <li>Things that cost a lot to change later</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Making an offer</h3>
      <p>In busy markets, your offer needs to stand out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look up what similar homes sold for</li>
        <li>Be flexible on when you can close</li>
        <li>Write a letter to the sellers</li>
        <li>Don't skip the inspection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The whole thing takes way longer than you think. But millions of people do this every year. Just take it one step at a time.</p>

    title: "5 Expensive Mistakes I Made Buying Rental Houses",
    excerpt: "I lost thousands of dollars making these mistakes. Learn from what I did wrong.",
    content: `
      <h2>How I lost money on rental houses</h2>
      <p>I thought I was being smart when I bought my first rental house. Turns out I made almost every mistake you can make. Here are the big ones that cost me money.</p>
      
      <h3>Mistake 1: I fell in love with the house</h3>
      <p>The house was beautiful. I could picture myself living there. But I forgot to check if it would actually make money:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly profit:</strong> Money left over after all expenses</li>
        <li><strong>Yearly return:</strong> How much you make compared to what you spent</li>
        <li><strong>1% rule:</strong> Monthly rent should be at least 1% of what you paid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pretty houses don't always make money. Check the numbers first.</p>
      
      <h3>Mistake 2: I forgot about all the extra costs</h3>
      <p>I only thought about the home loan payment. I forgot about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paying someone to manage the property</li>
        <li>Times when no one is renting it</li>
        <li>Fixing things that break</li>
        <li>Big replacements like roofs and air conditioners</li>
        <li>Property taxes going up</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mistake 3: I bought in the wrong area</h3>
      <p>The house was cheap, so I thought it was a good deal. I didn't check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If people actually wanted to live there</li>
        <li>Crime rates and school quality</li>
        <li>Job opportunities in the area</li>
        <li>What other rentals were charging</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cheap houses in bad areas stay cheap for good reasons.</p>
      
      <h3>Mistake 4: I borrowed too much money</h3>
      <p>The bank said I could borrow more, so I did. Bad idea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher payments ate up all my profit</li>
        <li>No money left when things needed fixing</li>
        <li>Couldn't buy other good deals</li>
        <li>Got really stressed when the market went down</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mistake 5: I tried to do everything myself</h3>
      <p>I thought I'd save money by doing it all. Instead I:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spent weekends fixing things I was bad at</li>
        <li>Made expensive mistakes on repairs</li>
        <li>Got stressed out by tenant calls</li>
        <li>Missed tax breaks I didn't know about</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>Buying rental houses can work, but it's not easy money. Start small, learn as you go, and pay professionals for things you don't understand. Most importantly, make sure the numbers work before you buy.</p>
      
      <p>My second rental house went much better because I learned from these mistakes.</p>

    excerpt: "Your home inspection can save you from expensive surprises. Here's what to pay attention to.",
    content: `
      <h2>Getting the most from your home inspection</h2>
      <p>The home inspection is your chance to find problems before they become your problems. Always hire a professional, but knowing what to look for helps you ask better questions.</p>
      
      <h3>Outside the house</h3>
      <h4>Foundation and structure</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cracks in the foundation (small ones are usually okay)</li>
        <li>Water damage or wet spots</li>
        <li>Ground sloping away from the house</li>
        <li>Any sagging or obvious problems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Roof and gutters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Missing or broken shingles</li>
        <li>Gutters pulling away or full of leaves</li>
        <li>Flashing around chimneys</li>
        <li>Signs of ice damage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Inside systems</h3>
      <h4>Electrical</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical panel looks good</li>
        <li>Special outlets in bathrooms and kitchen</li>
        <li>No exposed or damaged wiring</li>
        <li>All lights and outlets work</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Plumbing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Good water pressure</li>
        <li>Signs of leaks</li>
        <li>Age of pipes and water heater</li>
        <li>Drains work properly</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Heating and cooling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Age of furnace and AC</li>
        <li>Ductwork condition</li>
        <li>System heats and cools evenly</li>
        <li>Clean filters</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Warning signs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh paint everywhere:</strong> What are they hiding?</li>
        <li><strong>Musty smells:</strong> Could be mold or water problems</li>
        <li><strong>Lots of extension cords:</strong> Not enough outlets</li>
        <li><strong>Uneven floors:</strong> Foundation problems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>After the inspection</h3>
      <p>Every house has some problems. Figure out which ones matter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety problems:</strong> Fix these before you move in</li>
        <li><strong>Expensive repairs:</strong> Get quotes and ask seller to fix</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmetic stuff:</strong> Usually not worth fighting over</li>
        <li><strong>Normal wear:</strong> Expected in any used home</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>When to walk away</h3>
      <p>Sometimes problems are too big:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Major structural problems</li>
        <li>Electrical that needs complete replacement</li>
        <li>Lots of water damage</li>
        <li>Systems that are about to die</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>No house is perfect. The goal is to understand what you're buying and avoid expensive surprises.</p>

    title: "Home Loan Rates: When to Lock and When to Wait",
    excerpt: "Home loan rates change all the time. Here's how to think about timing your rate.",
    content: `
      <h2>Understanding home loan rates</h2>
      <p>Home loan rates can make a huge difference in what you pay. Half a percent might not sound like much, but it can mean tens of thousands over 30 years.</p>
      
      <h3>What affects rates</h3>
      <h4>Big picture stuff</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal Reserve policy</li>
        <li>Inflation and how the economy is doing</li>
        <li>Job market</li>
        <li>Bond market</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Your situation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit score (740+ gets best rates)</li>
        <li>Down payment (20%+ avoids extra insurance)</li>
        <li>How much debt you have</li>
        <li>Type of loan and how long</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>When to lock your rate</h3>
      <h4>Lock if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rates are going up:</strong> Lock as soon as you're approved</li>
        <li><strong>You found your home:</strong> Lock when you have a contract</li>
        <li><strong>You like the rate:</strong> If it fits your budget, lock it</li>
        <li><strong>Closing soon:</strong> Less than 45 days</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Wait if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rates are going down:</strong> Wait for better rates</li>
        <li><strong>Still looking for houses:</strong> No point locking without a house</li>
        <li><strong>Long time until closing:</strong> More than 60 days</li>
        <li><strong>Expecting rates to drop:</strong> Based on economic news</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Types of rate locks</h3>
      <h4>Standard lock</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Usually 30-60 days</li>
        <li>Often free for normal timeframes</li>
        <li>Rate and points guaranteed</li>
        <li>Extensions cost extra</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Float-down options</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Lets you get lower rate if rates drop</li>
        <li>Costs extra upfront</li>
        <li>Usually needs 0.25% drop minimum</li>
        <li>Must use before closing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Reading the signs</h3>
      <h4>Rates might go up if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fed talks about raising rates</li>
        <li>Strong economy and low unemployment</li>
        <li>Inflation going up</li>
        <li>Bond yields increasing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Rates might go down if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Economic uncertainty</li>
        <li>Fed talks about keeping rates low</li>
        <li>Inflation going down</li>
        <li>People buying more bonds</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Common mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waiting for perfect rate:</strong> It doesn't exist</li>
        <li><strong>Not shopping around:</strong> Rates vary between lenders</li>
        <li><strong>Only looking at rate:</strong> Check all costs</li>
        <li><strong>Letting locks expire:</strong> Extensions are expensive</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>Rate timing is part strategy, part luck. Focus on getting a rate you can afford rather than trying to time it perfectly. Remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can refinance if rates drop a lot</li>
        <li>Waiting might cost more than you save</li>
        <li>Your money situation matters more than timing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Work with a good loan officer who can help you make decisions based on your situation.</p>

      <h3>Is it worth the effort?</h3>
      <p>Good preparation usually costs 1-3% of your home's value but can increase sale price by 5-10% and help it sell weeks faster. Focus on cleanliness, basic fixes, and making it move-in ready.</p>
      
      <p>You're not just selling a house - you're selling a lifestyle. Make it easy for buyers to imagine living there.</p>
